### Installing AWS CLI

I was not able to use Gitpod or Github codespaces due to browser issues.
So I decided to use a local environment.

In order to prove that I am able to use AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
